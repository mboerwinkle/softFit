FIXME's
be sure to fclose all files
have a list of presets that are loaded on launch
only sort the amount that are going to be examined +1
clarify which inputs need to be doubles and which need to be ints
Better sort than insertion
fix variety of memory leaks and initialization errors
multicore (dual rasppi should be faster than this)
scrub all inputs (simon testing)
Save background of all minimums
